Take 2 integers a and b as input and use Euclidean algorithm to find the 
greatest commom divisor of a and b and find a linear combination of a and b which 
is equal to gcd(a, b). In another word, find two integers s and t such that
gcd(a,b) = sa+tb.

There are two versions, EuclideanWithSteps.c print also the steps of the computation.
The sudo code and the explanation of my algorithm will be found in my algorithm handout PDF file.
